# Mortgage Calculator

Super simple mortgage calculator, allowing you to play with the following variables:

```
# How much money is left on your mortgage? 
OUTSTANDING_AMOUNT = 605229

#How many years on your mortgage?
YEARS = 30

# What is your interest rate?
# 0.0515 = 5.15% interest
INTEREST_RATE = 0.0641

# Once your terms are set, you can pay extra money up front.
# What difference does that make for you? 
EXTRA_PAYDOWN = 0
```

### How to run
